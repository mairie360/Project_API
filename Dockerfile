# --- Stage 2: runtime (distroless, non-root) ---
# The `nonroot` variant runs as uid/gid 65532. `USER` is repeated numerically so
# Kubernetes can enforce `runAsNonRoot: true`. The API binds an unprivileged
# port (`PORT`, 3000+) and never writes to the filesystem. The binary stays
# owned by root (read + execute only for the runtime user).
