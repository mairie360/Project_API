-- Volume seed of the performance stack (MAIR-474), run by the `seeder` service after
-- init-test.sql. Without it the lists k6 reads hold a handful of rows and the costs that grow
-- with the data (visibility predicate per project, rows numbered by `paged_rows_sql!`, history
-- and comment feeds) are never measured.
--
-- - 2 000 agents (`User`, ids 100001..102000) and 100 Responsables (ids 103001..103100), each
--   Responsable owning a group of 20 agents: load-test.js signs their tokens to read as a
--   non-admin, the expensive branch of `project_visible_to_user_sql!`;
-- - 5 000 projects owned by the agents, 5 members each, 10 tasks each (50 000 tasks, their
--   `task_created` history written by the database trigger);
-- - project 12 (init-test.sql) becomes the hot project: 300 members, 2 000 tasks, and task 87
--   gets 1 000 comments and 1 000 status changes, so its pages are read deep.
--
-- Fixed ids, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING / NOT EXISTS: the file is idempotent, like init-test.sql.
