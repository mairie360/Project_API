# Rust API Template

This repository serves as a **template for building APIs in Rust**. It provides a solid foundation with recommended structure and configuration files to help you get started quickly and maintain consistency across projects.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your own API, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Your API Name

You must define the name of your API in the following files:

- `Cargo.toml` – Update the `[package]` name to match your API.
- `docker-compose.yml` and/or `Dockerfile` – Set the appropriate service/image name.
- `nginx.conf` – Adjust upstream and server blocks to reflect your API name.

This ensures correct identification and deployment of your API.

### 2. Document Your API

Don't forget to fill out the `API.md` file to describe your API's endpoints, authentication mechanisms, error handling, and any other relevant documentation. This is crucial for both development and future maintenance.

Feel free to fork this template and customize it according to your project needs. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## Integration tests (newman)

The end-to-end scenario lives in `tests/postman/collection.json` (Postman v2.1 collection) with
its variables in `tests/postman/environment.json`. CI replays it with the `postman/newman` image
against the published `dev-<sha>` API image (`IMAGE_REF`), without any Postman account. Locally,
leave `IMAGE_REF` empty and the script builds `project-api:local` from `development.Dockerfile`:

```bash
./integration_test.sh
```

The script starts `docker-compose-integration.yml` (Postgres + Liquibase + seeder + Redis + API +
newman), waits for the `newman` service, prints its report and exits with its status (`--bail`
stops at the first failing request). To iterate on the collection against a stack already running
on `localhost:3001`:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host -v "$PWD/tests/postman:/etc/newman:ro" postman/newman:6.1.3-alpine \
  run collection.json --environment environment.json
```
